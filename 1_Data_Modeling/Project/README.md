This project demonstrates how to perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations using Python and Apache Cassandra. 
The project processes event data from CSV files and inserts it into a Cassandra database, where it can be queried to extract useful insights.

The project involves:
1. Extracting event data from CSV files located in a specified directory.
2. Transforming the data by consolidating it into a single CSV file.
3. Loading the transformed data into a Cassandra database.
4. Querying the database to retrieve specific data and demonstrate its functionality.
