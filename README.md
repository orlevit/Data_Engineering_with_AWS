# AWS Data Engineering with Udacity

This repository contains course details and projects from the **AWS Data Engineering** program on Udacity. This program focuses on designing data models, building data warehouses and data lakes, automating data pipelines, and managing massive datasets using AWS tools.

## Course Overview

- **Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra**
  - Model event data for a non-relational database.
  - Build an ETL pipeline for a music streaming app using Apache Cassandra.
  - Define queries and tables.

- **Data Warehouse**
  - Act as a data engineer for a streaming music service.
  - Build an ELT pipeline extracting data from S3, staging it in Redshift, and transforming it into dimensional tables.
  - Provide insights into what songs users are listening to.

- **Data Lakehouse with AWS**
  - Develop a data lakehouse solution for sensor data.
  - Build an ELT pipeline for lakehouse architecture using Spark and AWS Glue.
  - Process data into analytics tables and load them back into the lakehouse.

- **Automate Data Pipelines**
  - Learn data pipeline concepts and their application in data engineering.
  - Use Apache Airflow for creating and managing data pipelines.
  - Cover concepts including data validation, DAGs, data quality, and more.
  - Implement and put data pipelines into production.

## Tools and Technologies

- **AWS Tools:** Redshift, S3, Glue, and more.
- **Open-Source Tools:** Apache Cassandra, Apache Airflow.
- **Languages and Frameworks:** Spark.
